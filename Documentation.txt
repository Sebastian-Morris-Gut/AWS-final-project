In this Documentation, we will be looking at how to deploy the app.py and its endpoints

1) Download AWS CLI
2) Create a S3 bucket, upload:
  - The Model (finalized_random_forest_model.pkl)
  - The app.py file
  - The design.html file
3) Start EC2 Instance with all the important permissions:
  - SSH port 22
  - HTTP port 80
  - Custom TCP port 5000

4) Upload to the EC2 instance via s3 bucket command:
  - aws s3 cp s3://s3 bucket name/file /home/ec2-user/
All the files that were in bucket
Upload "design.html" into a separate folder called "templates"

5) Download Python and Pip on the EC2 Instance (when using python3 and Python remember to update the symlink as there might be discrepancies in the versions)
6) pip install:
 - Requests
 - Flask
 - Scikit-learn (version 1.3.2) ==> available only on Python 3.8 and newer
 - Joblib

7) run the server with this command: flask --app app run --host=0.0.0.0
8) Navigate to the blank endpoint on your browser to find a form
  - The form needs a driver's ID
  - Qualifying Position
  - q1, q2, q3 times
  - If he got a Grid Penalty
  - Years of Experience

All the values are integers (except for the Grid Penalty)

The list of Drivers and driverID are in "activedrivers 1.csv"
